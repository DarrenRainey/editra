VERSION 0.0.84
DATE 01/15/2007
Eleventh Snapshot Release

NEWS:
  The goals of the work on this version were focused on a general cleanup and
  refactoring of the core modules as much of the code in these modules has been
  there since I first started getting my feet wet with python and wx widgets.

  The main cleanup effort was focused on the text control code. This lead to a
  complete reworking of the syntax management code into its own separate subsystem.
  This allowed for some minor performance improvments as well as a slightly smaller
  memory footprint since the editor now dynamically loads syntax settings/specs 
  only when they are needed instead of preloading all supported syntax/style specs
  like it previously did.

  Also as of this release all changes where made using Editra to edit itself. 
  Which has allowed me do bug testing while I work and see what parts of the 
  editor are lacking. 

NEW: [features/improvements]
+More configuration options available in Preference Dialog
+The editor now has 2 distinct modes of operation that can be configured by
 setting the MODE value in your profile. The default mode is CODE which just
 runs the editor in a normal mode. The second mode is DEBUG it will create and
 run a debugging window that displays all the programs debugging information.
+Enhanced debugging messages
+Improved Syntax/Filetype Detection
+More Complete/Accurate Syntax definitions for all supported languages
+Improved Brace/Bracket Highlighting
+AutoComp/Keyword Helper is now bound to ALT key and toggles on/off by pushing 
 button again.
+Optimized bytecode for Mac OS X binaries
+"Improved" Printing Support (its better but still mostly broken)
+Editor can remember its window size/position on exit and automatically restore 
 it self to that size/position on next launch.
+More complete Japanese translation

BUG FIXES:
+Proper setting of page images
+Menu Updateing Fixes
+Proper handling of file save/saveas errors

VERSION 0.0.80
DATE 12/02/2006
Tenth Snapshot Release

NEWS:
  I've been fairly busy and hopefully it shows. I did a more thourough testing
  of the program and was able to flush out a fair number of bugs, while at the
  same time making some big improvements in usability and new features.

  Major UI upgrades and improvements to page management/layout system.

  The initial implimentation of the the plugin system for customizing the
  menus language is in place. It is a fairly simple system uses a custom
  python module as the language source. For a more complete explanation see
  the sample English module in the languages directory of your installation.

  The Preferences Dialog can now be used to configure the interfaces language
  and some of the other features such as Syntax Highlighting and Indentation Guides.
  Changing the language however requires closing and restarting the editor before
  the changes will take effect.

  UTF8 Support has temporarly been disabled until a number of bugs related to
  it can be resolved.
