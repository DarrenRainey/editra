07/16/06: There is now Doxygen generated documentation available
          Online for developmental reference:

          http://codeman.dnsdojo.org:2402/pypad_doc

          For those of you with shell accounts on the server
          there are also man pages available.

05/23/06: Note to developers working on Windows the path 
	  resolution method is set to work off of the install
	  path when the project is build as an exe. This means
	  that you will get error messages about not being
	  able to find the icons and being unable to load
	  the profile because of this.

	  These can be safely ignored and you should not fix
	  it. However if it becomes a problem you can temporarly
	  fix it in your own dev folder by doing the following.

	  Solution 1:
          Copy the pixmaps and profiles directories to the src directory
          
	  Solution 2:
	  In pp_util.py go to the function ResolvConfigDir and
	  change all the lines in the 'if' statement for win32
	  that match the following line as shown.

	   pro_path = path_char.join(pieces[:-1])

	   TO

	   pro_path = path_char.join(pieces[:-2])

	  However DO NOT commit these changes back to the 
	  repository. if you need to commit changes in pp_util
	  makes sure to revert the above changes before you
	  commit or it will cause problems with the Windows
	  build.

04/13/06: The cvs server is currently being hosted on a box at
	  my house. It is possible that this machine will be
	  down from time to time.
