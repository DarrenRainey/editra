I hope to make this editor accessible to as many people as possible and part of that is providing the editor in as many localized languages as possible. I am currently looking some people that are willing to do some additional translations for the editor. The editor is currently available in English and Japanese. 

Translations are handled by the gettext system using .po files. If you are interested in providing a translation or even partial translation the main po file can be found in the svn repository under '/scripts/i18n/messages.pot'. All I can offer in return is credit on the projects homepage as well a link to your homepage (if you have one). If you are interested or require more information please feel free to contact me (cprecord@editra.org).
